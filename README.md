# MiniComputer

A mini computer app using commands to interact with the user.  
A bit like the early dos computers (i guess)  
Using C# and .NET  


## Tree like directory system:  

You can create directories inside directories forever


## Image system:

Use hex numbers to show a pixel color  
New line means new row of pixels  
You can use spaces as much as you like between numbers  
See ConsoleColors.txt for all colors available and their hex number

On boot up, chose the save file to load  
Save all currently active files and directories
